<img src="./images/undraw_credit_card_payment.svg" alt="Money" style="width: 30%; display: block; margin: auto">
<p>Thanks for your interest in accepting donations with Titcoin! Starting to accept donations with Titcoin will have the following benefits for you:</p>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<ol>
	<li>It is totally free of charge, there are no additional costs.</li>
	<li>You have full control over your money.</li>
	<li>We will repost your content on social media to help you to grow your follower base and receive more donations.</li>
	<li>If you want, we can add a link to your profile on this homepage, to further increase your visibility!</li>
	<li>You will receive donations from other Titcoin community members, which can be converted into Bitcoin (BTC).</li>
</ol>

<p>So, how do you get started? In all cases, in order to receive titcoins, you need a <b>Titcoin address</b>. A Titcoin address looks like this: <b>1Q2oBNFG5GhceW4sFA5UB3KEry366heAv8</b> (it's basically just a bunch of random characters starting with "1"). You can publish your Titcoin address on the internet in order to receive donations. There are different ways of getting a Titcoin address, each have their pros and cons.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="#wallet" class="link">Option #1 (recommended): Use the official Titcoin wallet</a></li>
	<li><a href="#novaexchange" class="link">Option #2: Use a deposit address on NovaExchange</a></li>
	<li><a href="#yobit" class="link">Option #3: Use a deposit address on Yobit</a></li>
	<li><a href="#developer" class="link">Option #4: Use the developer address</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="app__main__subtitle" id="wallet"><a href="#wallet">Option #1 (recommended): Use the official Titcoin wallet</a></h3>
<a class="link" href="./images/screenshots/overview.png"><img src="./images/screenshots/overview.png" alt="Overview"></a>
<p>The <b>Titcoin wallet</b> is a program for the PC (Windows, Mac, Linux), which you can use to send, receive and store your Titcoin funds. You can download it under <a href="download.html" class="link">Download</a> and take a look at the screenshot tour under <a href="screenshots.html" class="link">Screenshots</a>.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You have full control over your titcoins. Nobody else can touch them! ;)</li>
	<li>No registration is necessary, no personal information is required.</li>
	<li>You will learn and understand how cryptocurrencies work.</li>
	<li>You only need to install the wallet once in order to get a Titcoin address. You can receive titcoins to that address later, even if the program is not running.</li>
	<li>You can have multiple Titcoin addresses.</li>
	<li>Best option for long-term storage of Titcoin.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You need a PC.</li>
	<li>You need to install and synchronize the wallet on the first startup.</li>
	<li>You need to store a backup of the wallet data, to avoid accidentally losing access to your coins.</li>
	<li>If you want to sell your titcoins later, you will have to transfer them to a cryptocurrency exchange, first.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="app__main__subtitle" id="novaexchange"><a href="#novaexchange">Option #2: Use a deposit address on NovaExchange</a></h3>
<a class="link" href="./images/screenshots/titcoin-on-novaexchange.png"><img src="./images/screenshots/titcoin-on-novaexchange.png" alt="Titcoin on Novaexchange"></a>
<p><a href="https://novaexchange.com/" class="link">NovaExchange</a> is a <b>cryptocurrency exchange</b>, which is a platform for trading different cryptocurrencies. On this site, you can also trade Titcoin (TIT) for Bitcoin (BTC)! For that matter, it is possible to generate a Titcoin address on Novaexchange in order to deposit Titcoin. If you publish this address on the internet, you can use it to receive donations.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You don't need a PC.</li>
	<li>You don't need to install a software on your PC (in case you have one).</li>
	<li>There is no need to make a backup of your wallet.</li>
	<li>You can directly sell your titcoins for Bitcoin on the same site.</li>
	<li>NovaExchange is a relatively trustworthy website.</li>
	<li>Good user support.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Novaexchange requires you to verify yourself with your phone number, address and real name. This will NOT be publicly visible though.</li>
	<li>Your titcoins are controlled by NovaExchange, not by yourself. If the site gets hacked, your coins might get stolen.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="app__main__subtitle" id="yobit"><a href="#yobit">Option #3: Use a deposit address on Yobit</a></h3>
<a class="link" href="./images/screenshots/titcoin-on-yobit.png"><img src="./images/screenshots/titcoin-on-yobit.png" alt="Titcoin on Yobit"></a>
<p>Similarly to NovaExchange, <a href="https://yobit.net/en/" class="link">Yobit</a> is another <b>cryptocurrency exchange</b> that you can use to store your titcoins. Unlike NovaExchange, Yobit is NOT a trustworthy site though, it is infamously known for various shady practices that could be called a scam.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
	<li>No personal information (except for an email address) is required in order to use the site.</li>
	<li>You don't need a PC.</li>
	<li>You don't need to install a software on your PC (in case you have one).</li>
	<li>There is no need to make a backup of your wallet.</li>
	<li>You can directly sell your titcoins for Bitcoin on the same site.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Yobit is basically operated by known scammers. Use it at your own risk!</li>
	<li>There is hardly any user support.</li>
	<li>Your titcoins are controlled by Yobit, not by yourself. If the site gets hacked, your coins might get stolen.</li>
	<li>Yobit does not require enough confirmations for Titcoin deposits, so buying Titcoin on Yobit is not secure. This means that if you are trying to sell your titcoins on Yobit, you will usually get less Bitcoin for it than on other exchanges.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="app__main__subtitle" id="developer"><a href="#developer">Option #4: Use the developer address</a></h3>
<p>If you are not interested in receiving Titcoin donations, here is one other option for you: Instead of publishing your own Titcoin address, you can use the following address that is owned by Gandalf86 (the developer): <b>1Q2oBNFG5GhceW4sFA5UB3KEry366heAv8</b>. Any payments going to this address will be considered as donations to the Titcoin project.

<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
	<li>We will still spread your posts on social media and help you to grow your follower base, if your posts contain the word "#titcoin".</li>
	<li>You are supporting the Titcoin project. Your donations will usually be forwarded to other content creators who accept Titcoin donations.</li>
	<li>No further action is necessary, you can just copy the above address and add it to your posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>You will not be able to receive any titcoins yourself.</li>
</ul>
