# Welcome to Titcoin!

Titcoin is a Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency for the adult industry and for the amateur pornography community. The core values of our community are freedom and tolerance.

The project was started in January 2014, which makes Titcoin one of the first altcoins that were created after Bitcoin and one of the oldest cryptocurrencies that are still active today!

Titcoin is not a general purpose cryptocurrency, but is method for transferring value inside our Titcoin community. Possible use cases for Titcoin include:

* Tipping your favorite amateur pornography creators
* Buying content from premium porn sites
* Tipping on webcam sites
* Buying Titcoin merchandise with Titcoin
* Buying sex toys and lingerie
* Enabling women to pay for drinks by showing their tits
* Incentivizing women to show off their tits on social media
* Promoting the use of cryptocurrencies within the adult entertainment scene
