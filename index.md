# Welcome to Titcoin!

Titcoin is a Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency that aims to revolutionize the world of online pornography. The core values of our community are freedom and tolerance.

The project was started in January 2014, which makes Titcoin one of the first altcoins that were created after Bitcoin and one of the oldest cryptocurrencies that are still active today!

Titcoin is not a general purpose currency like Bitcoin, but is exclusively being used for trading pictures, videos and other adult related things. Use cases for Titcoin include:

* Trading nudes and custom content
* Incentivizing the creation of amateur pornography
* Tipping and supporting your favorite content creators
* Buying and selling Titcoin merchandise
* Promoting the use of cryptocurrencies in the adult entertainment scene

# FAQ

### Is this a joke?

No. Titcoin is a real cryptocurrency that actually exists!

### Is Titcoin a scam?

No. Titcoin exists since 2014 and is entirely operated by volunteers. We never ask you for money, but you are free to trade coins with other users.

### Do you have a mobile app?

Not yet! Feel free to create one :)

### How does Titcoin work?

You can do many fun things with Titcoin, but if you are looking for an example use case we would recommend you to look at our subreddit [ShowMyTitCoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/showmytitcoin/?f=flair_name%3A%22Titcoin%22), where girls can post their Titcoin address and get tipped for posting nudes!

In order to get started you can read the tutorial in our [Titcoin wiki](https://github.com/titcoin/doc/wiki).

### Why can't I just use Bitcoin, Litecoin, Monero etc.?

You can, but using Titcoin is more fun! ;) Also, girls can get free titcoins by posting nudes in our Discord, which is not possible with other cryptocurrencies.

On a more serious note, we believe that domain-specific currencies like Titcoin do have their place because they have an exchange rate that is independent of larger cryptocurrencies. Like in the real world, having independent currencies can accelerate innovation in certain sub-economies such as the adult industry in our case.
