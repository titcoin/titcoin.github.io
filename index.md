# Welcome to Titcoin!

Titcoin is a Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency for the adult industry and for the amateur pornography community.

The project was started in January 2014, which makes Titcoin one of the first altcoins that were created after Bitcoin and one of the oldest cryptocurrencies that are still active today!

Titcoin does not aim to be a serious general purpose currency, but rather exists for the fun of it. ;) Possible use cases for Titcoin include:

* Tipping amateur pornography creators
* Buying content from premium porn sites
* Tipping on webcam sites
* Buying Titcoin merchandise with Titcoin
* Buying sex toys and lingerie
* Enabling women to pay for drinks by showing their tits
* Incentivizing women to show off their tits on social media
* Promoting the use of cryptocurrencies within the adult entertainment scene
