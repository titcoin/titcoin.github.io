        <div class="col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3">
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Titcoin was founded in early 2014 by the entrepreneurs Edward Mansfield and Richard Allen. It was one of the very original altcoins, only a few different cryptocurrencies were widely known at that time (Wikipedia). Titcoin received a lot of media attention in 2014.</p>

        <p>In April 2016, the Bittrex account of the Titcoin founders was hacked and all project funds were stolen (Source). They decided to quit and started looking for other developers interested in taking over Titcoin development.</p>

        <p>One year later, in May 2017, Titcoin development was finally handed over to a company called "Joy Toilet", but they never did actual development work on Titcoin.</p>

        <p>In Q3 2018, the owner of Joy Toilet started facing financial issues and sold his access to the official Titcoin accounts to the developers of TittieCoin (TTC), another adult cryptocurrency. Under all accounts it was stated that "Titcoin has been bought out by TittieCoin for an undisclosed amount". The TittieCoin developers then started to claim that they are the legitimate "owner" of Titcoin and promoted that all Titcoin users would have to swap their TIT coins to TTC. </p>

        <p>So that's why we started building our own community and making our own Titcoin wallet. We're proving that a cryptocurrency can not be "owned" by a few people, but is controlled by the community! Cool A new Titcoin wallet based on Bitcoin 0.16.3 was released by Gandalf86 on Nov. 9, 2018.</p>

        <h3>What is Titcoin</h3>
        <p>Titcoin is a cryptocurrency for the adult community. It is exactly what you would expect from a currency called Titcoin!</p>

        <p>Titcoin can be used for:<br>
         
        * Paying at adult online stores</br>
        * Rewarding girls for sharing boob pictures</br>
        * Tipping on webcam sites</br>
        * Investing money in the power of tits</br>
        </p> 
        <p>You can basically use Titcoin for anything you like! Only your imagination is the limit.</p>
        <p>Titcoin is fun, but it is not just fun! It is also serious. Titcoin is closely following the Bitcoin Core development in order to achieve high software quality and robustness. We're employing unit tests and regression tests to ensure continuous quality during development. The main difference of Titcoin compared to Bitcoin is a faster block time that allows us to compensate a lower transaction volume with higher transaction speed, and a different retargeting algorithm.</p>
